### Installing


Step 1. Find the two data files [students.csv , teachers.parquet] and save them locally to your machine.

Step 2. Follow the appropriate installation instructions in the above link.

Step 3. Once Python is installed on your machine, open Python and import the following Python Libraries: 

-Pandas, CSV, PyArrow(Parquet), JSON
